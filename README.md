# Pokémon Blaze Black 2 Hardcore Nuzlocke Rules
These are rules for a hardcore Pokémon Black Black 2 Hardcore Nuzlocke that will be completed on https://twitch.tv/liugia

<b>Start date: February 10th, 2025</b>

## General Rules
1) Can only catch the first Pokémon seen on each route/cave/town.
2) All Pokémon must have nicknames.
3) If a Pokémon faints, it is dead and no longer usable. Must put it in a death box or release it, no exceptions.
4) No items allowed during battle, no exceptions. The only items allowed to be used during battle are held items.
5) There is a set level cap per gym. Pokémon may level above this cap during battle but not before or else they are deemed unusable until that gym is beaten.
6) Battle must be in Set mode.
7) No breeding allowed.
8) HM slaves are allowed but cannot be used in battle or leveled at all.
9) Once a gym has been entered, you cannot leave it until complete.
10) Pokémon have different ways of evolving in this game. (Ex. Eevee uses Sun Stone to turn into Espeon and Moon Stone to Umbreon). This also changes some Pokémon and the levels needed to evolve. Changelong for Blaze Black 2 can be found below. https://pastebin.com/QNscPrV1
11) Pokémon have been balanced to not be completely useless too. (Ex. Magcargo line, Tropius, etc.) 

<ins>Special In-world Encounters</ins>  - All in-world encounters can be caught and will not count towards your first encounter (as long as they are not dupes). \
<ins>Shiny Clause</ins> - Given that a shiny Pokémon is RANDOMLY found, you may catch it. No hunting a shiny specifically for that encounter.\
<ins>Dupe Clause</ins>  - If the first encounter is a Pokémon that's already been caught, it can be skipped, and the next Pokémon found will be deemed the "first encounter".
